Maven Framework: Lifecycle -> Phase -> Plugin:Goal
    https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html#Lifecycle_Reference
    Lifecycles are: clean, default and site
   The clean lifecycle has the pre-clean, clean, post-clean phases
   Some default lifecycle phases are: initialize, validate, compile, test, package, deploy + others
   mvn clean phase is mapped to a plugin:goal -> maven-clean-plugin:2.5:clean by default
   So mvn clean calls the the clean goal in the plugin maven-clean-plugin version 2.5
mvn dependency:help : Plugin help, works with other plugins !!
mvn dependency:tree : Show all dependencies in a tree
mvn dependency:go-offline : Download all dependencies so you can then work offline
Maven dependencies have different scopes defined in the POM file ie. compile (default), runtime, test etc
    If you define your own dependencies make sure you get the scope right
    (ie. you don't need JUnit for running the application so use <scope>test</scope> in POM)
mvn -N io.takari:maven:wrapper -Dmaven=3.6.0 : Add the maven wrapper (version) to your project

1. A lambda is essentially an anonymous function (method). You couldn't get a reference to a function and pass it around like a object
2. Although nothing more than anonymous methods, they are called functions as they aren't connected to a class. Methods are attached to a class
3. Lambda structure: (parameters) -> {block of code}
4, Example:
    (p1,p2,p3) -> { line1;
                    line2;
                    line3;
                  }

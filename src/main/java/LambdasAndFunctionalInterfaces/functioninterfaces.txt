1. Methods are defined as code that are restricted to classes
2. Functions are defined as code that is considered first class in that it can be defined and then passed around and used in multiple classes
   like a parameter ie. parameterize behaviour
3. Prior to Java 8 this was done by wrapping the function around wrapped in an object, often as an anonymous inner class
4. A functional interface is defined as an interface with one single method

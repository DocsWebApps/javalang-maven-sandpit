1. Functional interface package is a set of general purpose functional interfaces in the JDK.
2. They provide templates so the compiler knows what your lambda method signature and return type should conform to.
3. Predicate, Consumer, Supplier and Function are examples -  see JavaQuiz::BeerProcessorChallenger
4. Predicate<T> - takes a type T and returns a boolean
5. Consumer<T> - an expression that performs operations on an object as an argument and has no return type
6. Supplier<T> - provides an instance of a type (such as a factory)
7. Function<T,U> - transforms type T into type U

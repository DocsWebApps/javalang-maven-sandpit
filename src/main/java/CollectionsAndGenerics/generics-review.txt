Generics
--------
1. Generic uses the <> notation to indicate the type of a collection say
2. MyClass<AnyType> myObject = new MyClass<>(); - just use <> from Java 7 onwards.
   Infers type from reference definition. In JAva 9 also applies to inner classes

AutoBoxing
----------
1. Java has objects (or reference types) and primitives
2. Each primitive has an object wrapper class ie. int and Integer
3. Since Java 1.5 autoboxing/unboxing was introduced
    Integer myInt = 10; works as 10 is autoboxed for you.
